-- PYTHON REPL
-- A basic REPL that opens up as a horizontal split
-- * use `<leader>i` to toggle the REPL
-- * use `<leader>I` to restart the REPL
-- * `+` serves as the "send to REPL" operator. That means we can use `++`
-- to send the current line to the REPL, and `+j` to send the current and the
-- following line to the REPL, like we would do with other vim operators.
